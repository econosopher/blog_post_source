# Revenue Data Investigation Findings

## Summary
The API data and CSV data DO match correctly. The perceived "mismatch" was due to comparing different time periods.

## Key Findings

### 1. Monthly Data Matches
- **API June 2025**: $116,234,389
- **CSV June 2025**: $115,998,518
- **Difference**: $235,871 (only 0.2%)

This is an excellent match - the small difference could be due to:
- Data updates between CSV export and API query
- Rounding differences
- Minor app inclusion/exclusion differences

### 2. The $226M vs $124.8M "Mismatch" Explained
- **$226M**: This was June + July full months from the API
- **$124.8M**: This is June 27 - July 26 from the CSV (custom 30-day period)
- These are different time periods, so they should be different!

### 3. API Behavior Confirmed
- `time_range="month"` returns full calendar months
- `date="2025-06-01"` returns all of June (June 1-30)
- `date="2025-06-01", end_date="2025-07-31"` returns June + July combined

## Solution Implemented

The publisher analysis script now:
1. Uses monthly API calls for efficiency (1 call instead of 30)
2. Clearly indicates it's showing calendar month data
3. Includes date_start and date_end columns to show exact coverage

## Trade-offs

**Efficiency vs Precision**:
- Monthly API: Fast (1 call), but only calendar months
- Daily aggregation: Precise (any date range), but slow (30 calls)

For most use cases, calendar month data is sufficient and much more efficient.

## Verification
The data is correct. The API and CSV sources agree when comparing the same time periods.
